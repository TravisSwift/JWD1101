        <h1>Modal Windows</h1>
        <p>A modal window is a web page element that displays in front of and deactivates all other content on the page.
            In order to return the page's content, the user must either close the modal or perform some kind of task in the modal
            window.
        </p>

        <p>Modal gets it's name because it creates a secondary "mode" that the user interface operates in.</p>

        <p>A modal is different from a pop up in that the modal pervents the user from interacting with anything that is part of the 
            main page's content, where as a pop-up on a page can be ignored by the user.
        </p>

        <p>Modals are most useful when you need to focus the user on an important message or force them into completing a action before 
            continuing their browsing sessing on that page.
        </p>
