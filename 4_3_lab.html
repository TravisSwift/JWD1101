    <title>Module 4_3 Lab The Structure of HTML, Identifying Layouts</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>LAB: HTML Layout</h1>
    <p>Find three websites online and try to guess at what the HTML structure tags look like by viewing
        them. Then, open the inspect and inspect the tags. When you’ve completed this assignment,
        write about what you’ve learned about HTML structure. Your response should be at least two
        paragraphs and 500 words.
        </p>

        <h2>Website One</h2>
        
        <figure> <a href="./assets/images/4_3_nature_image1.png" target="_blank">
        <img src="./assets/images/4_3_nature_image1.png" width="300" alt="An analysis of the structure of Weird Al's Website"></a>
        </figure>

        <h2>Website Two</h2>

        <figure> <a href="./assets/images/4_3_nature_image2.png" target="_blank">
            <img src="./assets/images/4_3_nature_image2.png" width="300" alt="An image analysis of the structure of YouTube's website"></a>
            </figure>


        <h2>Website Three</h2>
        
        <figure> <a href="./assets/images/4_3_nature_image3.png" target="_blank">
            <img src="./assets/images/4_3_nature_image3.png" width="300" alt="An image analysis of the structure of Homestar Runner's website"></a>

        <H2> HTML ELEMENTS</H2>
        <P>An HTML document is structured in a hierarchical manner, consisting of elements nested within other elements. HTML structure is designed to make coding and reading of websites understandable and predictable. On a whole page level, the html element is the root element and it defines the entire HTML document. It has a start tag html and an end tag /html. Inside the html element, there is a body element, and the rest of the page's elements and content are written inside the body element.</p> 

        <h2>Understandable</h2>

        <p>The standards of HTML structure guide us to create code that is easy to understand. Using semantic elements gives us easily identifiable elements, which is important not just for the developer but also for clients or other developers who review the code. This is also helpful when collaborating on projects so developers can agree on the basic and minimum standards of coding. Elements are not just divs; paragraphs p and heading tags h1, h2, etc. are also elements and can be manipulated in the same way.</p>

        <p>It is important that HTML structure be easily understood by both a coder and a web browser. It is also crucial for screen readers and accessibility. The use of the figure element allows the browser to know there is an image in the element, and figcaption gives an on-screen text description while the alt attribute provides additional image information.</p>

        <h2>Predictable</h2>

        <p>The use of divs and semantic elements div, article, main, header, section, etc. puts content in blocks that have predictable results with alignment and placement on the page. Understanding HTML structure and the use of these elements allows developers to use element names, class names, and/or IDs to predictably manipulate the layout of elements and when adding cascading style sheets (CSS) to style the page.</p>

        <p>The use of divs and semantic elements follows standards but is also interpreted in a common way that allows creativity and personalization by the developer. One person might prefer to use very creative element, class, and ID names, while another uses simple and repetitive names, and both approaches will behave the same way on the web page. </p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p>While analyzing the three pages, the nav, header, and footer elements are easily identified. The divs, sections, and main elements are easy to see, but the names of those elements can vary based on the style of the developer. <br>

        On Weird Al's website, the header is used as a full-page image with content below. The header could have been a small image like a banner, but it would not have the same impact as Al's face on the entire page. The section element could have been named main, or simply div. The article elements could have been named figure, img, div, and they would have behaved the same. The div element containing the call to action could also have been named div or article, or any other name the developer preferred.</p>
            
        <p>The YouTube page uses very simple naming conventions and is a great example of stacked divs and a sidebar layout.</p>
            
        <p>The Homestar Runner web page is a simplistic layout using very few elements. The main page uses a header element as one large image and link with divs containing links to specific content and a simple footer.</p>
            
        <p>Using the same standards of HTML structure, we have three pages using elements in the same way that produce different results because of the CSS applied. Regardless of how the page looks, they follow the standards, naming conventions, and use of elements as any other modern website. Standards and common practices make coding accessable and understandable to all, new coders, experienced developers, web browsers and screen readers that create a consistent, understandable, predictable result. </p>
